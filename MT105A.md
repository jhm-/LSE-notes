## What will be on the exam?

The exam will be split into two parts, Section A and Section B, for 60 and 20
marks, respectively. The exam is always eight questions long - six questions in
the first part and two in the second. I would suggest doing Section B first.

Section B will present two 'wordy', multi-part questions, that will
definitely cover the topics of optimization and constrained optimization,
and may possibly cover compound interest or something else.

The optimization problems in Section B will almost definitely be economics
problems related to cost, utility and/or profit. The questions may be related
to an individual or a firm and the firm may be producing goods as a monopoly
or not. Every exam I have looked at has a constrained optimization problem in
which the student has to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Many of the
problems will ask the student to solve a general equation of optimization,
with variables in place of real numbers, and often the final solution is
provided and the instructions are to demonstrate the steps to arrive at that
solution.

The key to the exam is to know all of the variations of the optimization
problems and to ace this part of the test.

Section A will have six questions that will be much more brief, and cover
topics such as:

- integration
- solving variables using a matrix method
- compound interest
- the Hession test for critical points
- curve sketching
- anything else covered in the course material

If you can successfuly answer questions relating to the first five topics
then you will have no problem with Section A.

## Standard derivatives to memorize:

$f(x)$ | $f'(x)$
:---: | :---:
$x^k$ | $kx^{k-1}$
$e^x$ | $e^x$
$\ln(x)$ | $\frac{1}{x}$
$\sin(x)$ | $\cos(x)$
$\cos(x)$ | $-\sin(x)$

### 1. The sum rule:
If $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ then $h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$

### 2. The product rule:
If $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$ then $h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$

### 3. The quotient rule:
If $h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ then $h'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}
{g(x)^2}$

### 4. The chain rule:
If $h(x) = s(r(x))$ then $h'(x) = s'(r(x))r'(x)$

## Standard integrals to memorize:

$f(x)$ | $\int f(x)dx$
:---: | :---:
$x^n$, $n \neq -1$ | $\frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1} + c$
$\frac{1}{x}$ | $\ln |x| + c$
$\ln |x|$ | $x\ln(x) - x + c$
$e^x$ | $e^x + c$
$e^{\alpha x}$ | $\frac{1}{\alpha}e^{\alpha x} + c$
$\sin(x)$ | $-\cos(x) + c$
$\cos(x)$ | $\sin(x) + c$

### 1. The addition rule:
$\int f(x) + g(x)dx = \int f(x)dx + \int g(x)dx$

### 2. The constant rule:
$\int k \times f(x)dx = k \times \int f(x)dx$

### 3. Integration by parts:
$\int u\frac{dv}{dx}dx = uv - \int v\frac{du}{dx}dx$

The formula replaces one integral (that on the left) with another (that on the
right); the intention is that the one on the right is a simpler integral to
evaluate.

### 4. Integration by substituion:

When we change the variable by putting $x = x(u)$ in the integral of $f(x)$
then we must replace $dx$ by $(\frac{dx}{du})du$

To determine $\int f(x)dx$ we can solve $\int f(x(u))x'(u)du$ and then
substitute $x$ back for $x(u)$

For definite integrals, $\int_{x=a}^{x=b} f(x) dx
= \int_{u=\alpha}^{u=\beta} f(x(u))x'(u)du$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the
values of $u$ that correspond to $x=a$ and $x=b$

## Partial fractions:

An example:
\newline

$\frac{x}{x^2 + 5x + 4} = \frac{x}{(x + 1)(x + 4)} = \frac{A_1}{(x + 1)} + \frac{A_2}{(x + 4)}$
\newline

Cross multiply to obtain:
\newline

$A_1(x + 4) + A_2(x + 1) = x$

let $x = -4 \Longrightarrow A_2(-4 + 1) = -4 \Longrightarrow A_2 = \frac{4}{3}$

let $x = -1 \Longrightarrow A_1(-1 + 4) = -1 \Longrightarrow A_1 = -\frac{1}{3}$
\newline

Therefore, the partial fracion is:
\newline

$\frac{4}{3(x + 4)} - \frac{1}{3(x + 1)}$
\newline

## The second partial derivative test

The second partial derivative test is a method used in multivariable calculus to
determine if a critical point of a function is a local minimum, maxium or saddle
point.

First find the critical points, where the partial derivatives for each variable
is zero.

The Hessian function is: $H(x,y) = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2$

If, at a critical point, we have:

$H < 0$, then that point is a *saddle point.*

$H > 0$ and $f_{xx} > 0$ then that point is a *local minimum.*

$H > 0$ and $f_{xx} < 0$ then that point is a *local maximum*.

If $H = 0$ then the test fails!
